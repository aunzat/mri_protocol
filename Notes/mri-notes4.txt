TODO IMPORTANT: use FLAWS to remake MP2RAGE: with p2 instead of p3, just input TI1 550-650 -> TI1 = 630? (NOT 800! 500 nullifies deep grey matter, 700 almost nullifies cortical grey matter, so between 500-700!) and TI2 1500-2000! 1460 is good! (can try lower just in case? at 1750 it's a tiny bit worse - yes at 700-800 it's like MPRAGE with very low CSF, try with ) Should then have high quality AND speed like FLAWS! (the noisy 3D should not be the case anymore!). Flip angle first TI 4 degrees, flip angle TI2 (ie, higher TI) at 5 degrees. -> Disable Fat Suppression?

== Quiet (auditory noise reduction) sequences:
* Une explication et surtout des exemples de sons avec et sans "quiet": http://mriquestions.com/whats-that-noise.html
* Un autre: http://www.mrisafety.com/SafetyInfov.asp?SafetyInfoID=252
* Il y a aussi cette très intéressante étude: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206196&type=printable
* Et un article qui explique plus techniquement: https://docplayer.net/27974604-Quiet-zero-te-asl-brain-mr-angiography-can-outperform-3d-tof-at-1-5t.html

En particulier, j'ai trouvé cette explication du dernier lien très utile:
« The gradient magnetic field is the primary source of acoustic noise in MR procedures
(4, 6). This noise occurs during the rapid alterations of currents within the gradient coils.
These currents, in the presence of the strong static magnetic field of the MR system,
produce significant (Lorentz) forces that act upon the gradient coils. Acoustic noise is
produced when the forces cause motion or vibration of the gradient coils as they impact
against their mountings, which, in turn, flex and vibrate (7, 8). The acoustic noise varies
due to the alteration of the gradient output (rise time or amplitude) by modifying MR
imaging parameters. Noise tends to be enhanced by decreases in section thickness, field
of view, repetition time, echo time, and as field strentgh arises.
Several investigators have described the development of "quiet" pulse sequences, which
substantially decrease acoustic noise and are acceptable for MR imaging and functional
MRI examinations. To date two methods have been used to reduce noise - dampen/
isolate the gradient coil from the patient bore, or reduce switching rate. Both methods
have drawbacks; the first resulting in reduction of bore space and the second reducing
performance. Quieter techniques are feasible which minimize gradient switching over
the TR period by utilizing a 3D projection reconstruction with no excitation, pre-winding,
phase-encoding, refocus, or crusher gradients. This technique can reduce acoustic
noise levels by more than 30dBA while generating an isotropic volumetric acquisition. In
addition, the nearly zero-TE nature of the "Silent" protocol has the potential to provide
superior rendering due to reduced dephasing related signal loss.
"Quiet-Zero TE" ASL brain MR angiography Can Outperform 3D TOF at 1.5T »

Et en configurant la nouvelle machine VIDA, j'ai vu qu'il y avait des séquences "quiet" donc tu peux jeter un coup d'oeil avec les gens du département IRM.
