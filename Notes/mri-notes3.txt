* RESOLVE (readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains - rs-EPI): https://static.healthcare.siemens.com/siemens_hwem-hwem_ssxa_websites-context-root/wcm/idc/groups/public/@global/@imaging/@mri/documents/download/mdax/mzc0/~edisp/mr_app_resolve_final_121991554_1-00678917.pdf
Useful for DTI and also T1 maybe? Reduces susceptibility to motion-induced phase errors and SAR.
Can have SMS-RESOLVE-DTI

Data undersampling can also be combined with arterial spin labeling and 3D radial acquisition to improve the detection and characterization of intracranial arteriovenous shunts.
Also this whitepaper confirms that SMS3 DWI is equivalent to conventional (non SMS) DWI in terms of image quality.
BEST: RESOLVE vs PROPELLER DWI, RESOLVE is better in quality and faster: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807895
* SEMAC to reduce metallic artifacts

-> FLAIR: fast2-2 as good or better than before, but nofast is better than anything before!
