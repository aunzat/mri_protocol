BESTREF TOADD: 3D SPACE FLAIR is better, less artifacts in CSF (less CSF pulsation artifact), even for moving patients (focal epilepsy): http://www.ajnr.org/content/32/11/2054 and http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/early/2017/02/02/ajnr.A5080.full.pdf and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmri.24542 (with multi-slab 3D)
«Isotropic high resolution 3D FLAIR with adequate SNR still requires the use of a relatively long repetition time (~8s) to allow adequate signal recovery.» - the rest explains why using a lower TR mess up the usual equations, so we have to test by ourselves... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587400/

activate phase corrected! If phase reconstruction is activated, the user can activate a phase correction method, which
applies a homodyne filter on the phase images. The width of the filter window can be adjusted in
the UI (see below, recommended value is 48 pixels). This should result in no or at least reduced
phase wrapping. A very similar filter is used calculating SWI im
